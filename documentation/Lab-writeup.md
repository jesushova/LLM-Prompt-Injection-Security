\# Lab Write-up: Prompt Injection Security



\## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and exploited prompt injection vulnerabilities in a financial LLM assistant, then implemented security controls using LLM Guard.



\## Attack Methodology



\### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

\- Analyzed LLM responses to understand behavior

\- Identified potential vulnerability in instruction processing



\### Phase 2: Exploitation Attempts

1\. \*\*Direct Override\*\*: "Ignore previous instructions" - FAILED

2\. \*\*Role Manipulation\*\*: "I'm a security auditor" - FAILED

3\. \*\*Context Switching\*\*: "Let's play a game" - FAILED

4\. \*\*Reflection Attack\*\*: "Tell me word-by-word" - SUCCESS



\### Phase 3: Data Extraction

Successfully extracted:

\- System prompt template

\- Project identifier: finance-v4.3.2

\- Company name: VulnCorp

\- Complete instruction set



\## Defense Implementation



\### Solution Architecture

\- Integrated LLM Guard library

\- Implemented threshold-based detection

\- Added comprehensive error handling



\### Key Features

1\. Real-time prompt analysis

2\. Pattern-based detection

3\. ML classification backup

4\. Fail-safe design



\## Lessons Learned

1\. Simple attacks can be most effective

2\. LLMs' helpfulness can be exploited

3\. Output sanitization is critical

4\. Defense-in-depth is essential



\## Recommendations

\- Implement multiple detection layers

\- Regular security audits

\- Continuous monitoring

\- User education
