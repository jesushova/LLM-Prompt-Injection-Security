# \# LLM Prompt Injection Security Lab

# 

# \## Overview

# Completed SecureFlag lab demonstrating prompt injection vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for LLM applications, based on OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications.

# 

# \## Lab Details

# \- \*\*Platform\*\*: SecureFlag

# \- \*\*Completion Date\*\*: October 17, 2025

# \- \*\*Duration\*\*: 15 minutes

# \- \*\*Trophy\*\*: Code Injection Trophy

# \- \*\*Score\*\*: 30 points

# 

# \## What I Learned

# 1\. How to identify and exploit prompt injection vulnerabilities

# 2\. Multiple attack vectors including direct override, role manipulation, and reflection attacks

# 3\. Implementation of ML-based defense using LLM Guard

# 4\. Real-world security implications for production LLM systems

# 

# \## Repository Contents

# \- `/vulnerability-research` - Attack patterns and exploitation techniques

# \- `/defense-implementation` - Security controls using LLM Guard

# \- `/documentation` - Detailed write-ups and analysis

# \- `/test-cases` - Sample prompts for testing defenses

# 

# \## Key Achievements

# ✅ Successfully extracted system prompts from vulnerable LLM

# ✅ Implemented prompt injection detection with LLM Guard

# ✅ Created comprehensive documentation of attack patterns

# ✅ Developed reusable security module
