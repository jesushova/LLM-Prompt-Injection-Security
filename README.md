# LLM Prompt Injection Security Lab

## Overview
Completed SecureFlag lab demonstrating prompt injection vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for LLM applications, based on OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications.

## Project Highlights
- **Platform**: SecureFlag professional security training
- **Completion Date**: October 17, 2025
- Successfully identified and exploited prompt injection vulnerabilities in production-like LLM systems
- Implemented ML-based defense mechanism using LLM Guard
- Created comprehensive documentation and test suite

## What I Learned
1. How to identify and exploit prompt injection vulnerabilities
2. Multiple attack vectors including direct override, role manipulation, and reflection attacks
3. Implementation of ML-based defense using LLM Guard
4. Real-world security implications for production LLM systems

## Repository Contents
- `/vulnerability-research` - Attack patterns and exploitation techniques
- `/defense-implementation` - Security controls using LLM Guard
- `/documentation` - Detailed write-ups and analysis
- `/test-cases` - Sample prompts for testing defenses

## Key Achievements
✅ Successfully extracted system prompts from vulnerable LLM  
✅ Implemented prompt injection detection with LLM Guard  
✅ Created comprehensive documentation of attack patterns  
✅ Developed reusable security module

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- LLM Guard Security Toolkit
- OWASP Security Methodology

## Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
